# src/typings.d.ts

## Summary
Project‑local declaration stubs for external libraries that do not ship with TypeScript type definitions. These are intentionally minimal – they cover only the APIs that the Codex codebase relies on. If full type packages (e.g. `@types/shell‑quote`) are introduced later these stubs will be overridden automatically by the higher‑priority package typings.
