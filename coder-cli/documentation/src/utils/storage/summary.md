# Project Overview

    ## File Summaries

    ### 1. \`command-history.ts\`
    This file manages the command history functionality, providing methods to load, save, and manage command entries. It helps
     in maintaining a log of commands executed by the user while ensuring sensitive information is not stored.

    #### Key Functions:
    - **loadCommandHistory()**: Loads command history from a JSON file.
    - **saveCommandHistory(history, config)**: Saves command history to a file with a maximum size limit.
    - **addToHistory(command, history, config)**: Adds a new command to history if it does not contain sensitive information.
    - **isSensitiveCommand(command, additionalPatterns)**: Checks if a command contains sensitive information based on
    predefined patterns.
    - **clearCommandHistory()**: Clears the command history file.

    ### 2. \`save-rollout.ts\`
    This module is responsible for saving session data (referred to as \"rollouts\") to the user's home directory. It
    generates a unique filename for each session to avoid conflicts and organizes saved data into a structured JSON format.

    #### Key Functions:
    - **saveRolloutToHomeSessions(items)**: Saves the rollout data to a JSON file in the user's home sessions directory.
    - **saveRollout(items)**: Debounces multiple save requests by delaying the save operation for a brief period to optimize
    performance.

    ## Conclusion
    This documentation provides a brief overview of the functionalities present in the codebase. Each file plays a critical
    role in managing user commands and storing session data efficiently while ensuring sensitive data is handled
    appropriately.
